Gene Expression Analysis using DESeq2 in R
This is a beginner-friendly gene expression analysis project using the DESeq2 package in R. I used the built-in airway dataset, which contains RNA-seq data from human airway smooth muscle cells treated with dexamethasone.

Tools & Packages Used
R version: 4.5.1
Packages:
- DESeq2
- ggplot2
- pheatmap
- EnhancedVolcano
- airway (example dataset)

Files Included
1. R Script airways        - Main R script containing the full work flow
2. DESeq2_results.csv      - table of genes with log2 fold changes and p-values  
3. volcano_plot.png        - plot to show significant up/downregulated genes  
4. heatmap_top_genes.png   - expression pattern of top 20 DE genes

What I Did
- Installed and loaded all required packages
- Loaded the airway dataset and converted it to DESeq2 format
- Performed differential gene expression analysis
- Created a volcano plot and a heatmap to visualize results
- Saved all output files in a structured project folder

Why I Made This Project
As part of my self-learning in R for bioinformatics, I wanted to implement a hands-on gene expression analysis. This project helped me understand how to:
- Perform DE analysis using DESeq2
- Interpret log2 fold changes and adjusted p-values
- Visualize gene expression using plots
