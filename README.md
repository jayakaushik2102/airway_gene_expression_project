Gene Expression Analysis using DESeq2 in R

This is my small project where I used R programming to do gene expression analysis using the DESeq2 package. I worked with the built-in `airway` dataset which has RNA-seq data from human airway smooth muscle cells.

Tools and Packages Used

1. R version 4.5.1
2. DESeq2
3. ggplot2
4. pheatmap
5. EnhancedVolcano
6. airway (example dataset)

Files Included
1. R Script airways - Main R script containing the full work flow
2. DESeq2_results.csv - table of genes with log2 fold changes and p-values  
3. volcano_plot.png - plot to show significant up/downregulated genes  
4. heatmap_top_genes.png - expression pattern of top 20 DE genes

What I Did

1. Installed and loaded packages
2. Converted airway data to DESeq2 format
3. Ran differential gene expression
4. Created volcano plot and heatmap
5. Saved the output in a project folder

Why I Made This

I am learning R for bioinformatics and wanted to make a basic but meaningful project. This project helped me understand how to do DE analysis and visualize gene expression patterns.
